# Market Research Data Exercise -- December 2020/January 2021

### What is this?

This repo contains work for a take-home assignment for a market research automation company. This assignment was the stage in the interview process following an initial interview with a hiring manager. From completion of this assignment, I moved on to a second interview with a peer of the hiring manager, which was the extent of my progress.

### What was this take-home about?

For this assignment, I was assigned two questions/exercises. For Question 1 (work contained in **Question1.ipynb**), I was asked to obtain temperature and wind speed over the previous 5 days for a particular city from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and then make any kind of table/chart out of the obtained data. For Question 2 (work contained in **Question2.ipynb**), I was asked to use the data from **dataset.csv** to discuss some metrics to evaluate and interpretations I could draw from it (very open-ended). Segment 1 in the dataset was meant to represent sales data for a small European bakery, while Segment 2 was meant to represent a larger B2B bakery.

### How long did you have to do this assignment?

There was no specific time limit, but I was told not to spend more than a couple hours on it. I wound up submitting slightly more than a week after it was initially assigned, since this period coincided with the winter holidays, and the file associated with the second question was not initially sent to me when I was assigned these exercises (and was sent close to a week later). 

### Notes

Queston 1 was straightforward enough (although I probably could have used the main API rather than the [One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)), but I really didn't think I had a particularly good response for Question 2, both due to my limited knowledge of retail analytics and (relatedly, likely) not really seeing how some of the numbers within and between time periods related to one another and/or "added up" to calculate basic metrics like churn and retention. Also, although the second interview came after I submitted this assignment, I believe that my "passing" this assignment did not lead to the second interview (i.e., it was probably something I was expected to do once I advanced past the initial interview).
