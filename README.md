# The-Island-of-Misfit-Takehomes

This repository is an ongoing archive of my work on take-home assignments over the course of my search for a first full-time position in Data Science, which began in July 2018. It's been a challenge and at times quite miserable and deflating, but I've put this together because there absolutely is utility in keeping records of my work, thought processes and development, and also to have backed up references for a lot of common tasks in Python and its data science stack. It's also not lost on me that others out there looking to accomplish the same as me might stumble upon this repo and see some value in simply knowing what to expect to encounter with different companies and what does/does not work (although I might be flattering myself haha).

For each assignment, I've taken care not to be too specific about the company or position, unless the assignment requested initial delivery in the form of a public Github repo. I have also only included data and my work, none of the actual documentation for the assignments is included with any of the assignments. In all cases, I've documented the following:

* A description of the assigning company
* The representative stage in the process of the assingment and the outcome
* As much detail about what the assignment asked for as is possible
* How long I was given to complete the assignment
* Some additional notes, if applicable. Usually my reflections on the assignment, especially stuff that I could have done better even if the ultimate outcome was "good," but also some more description of what the code does and how to use it in some cases (in case anyone wishes to use it?)

None of these assignments were accompanied with explicit language forbidding any sharing through this kind of channel. Just to note, I have done multiple other take-homes where this was the case. I've also excluded a couple other assignments that I personally deemed as simply not "substantial" enough to have any value in archiving in this form.

In the near future (perhaps), I will also be sharing work on some individual questions I've encountered in technical, whiteboarding, pair programming or HackerRank-style interviews and assessments (at least those that I can recall offhand).

Finally, I've noticed the odd amount of traffic activity associated with this (and other!) repos of mine and am assuming for now it's not human. But if you are human and have found anything useful here, please drop me a line, it would actually pick me up.
