# DigitalX Assessment

### What is this?

This repo contains work for a take-home assignment for a software company providing solutions for detection and prevention of advertisting fraud. From completion of this assignment, I progressed to a final round interview, which was as far as I progressed.

### What was this take-home about?

This takehome assignment concerned DigitalX, a fictional digital ad exchange with a reputation for selling fraudulent inventory -- the ad space bought through this exchange is not generated by ordinary users but by bots or other malicious actors. 

Using the data in **fq_analytics_givt_test_data.csv**, 100,000 logs of individual ad-placement sales from DigitalX on a recent day sold into the exchange by 10 distinct sources, I was asked to identify signs of General Invalid Traffic (GIVT):

1. Ad requests that are being produced at an unnatural scale by a small number of users.
2. Ad requests that appear to come from scripts running off data center servers rather than standard broadband or wireless telecom providers.
3. Ad requests that have been made by scrapers or other self-identified bots visiting the site.
4. Ad requests that show signs of browser/IP manipulation (e.g., request inconsistencies), implying that the true source of the traffic is being obscured through spoofing.

More specifically, I was to judge how fraudulent each source's traffic was, along with an explanation of the type of fraud being committed and what to do with the source (eject from exchange or request chargebacks).
