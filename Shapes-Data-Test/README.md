# Shapes Data Test -- April 2019

### What is this?

This repo contains work for a take-home assignment for a software company which provides solutions for preventing fraud in online and mobile transactions. This assignment was the stage in the interview process following an initial phone screen. From completion of this assignment, I was informed that I passed and then moved on to a second phone screen, which was the extent of my progress.

### What was this take-home about?

For this assignment, I was asked to use the provided dataset **Analyst Coding Test.csv** to answer a series of questions which were mostly Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tasks. These questions and my answers are included in the notebook **Shapes Data Test.ipynb**.

### How long did you have to do this assignment?

48 hours.

### Notes

* I clearly misread question 2) as with respect to the area size of each shape as opposed to "the area size of each color".
* My interpretation of quesiton 4) was: given that a shape is green, which shape is most likely?
