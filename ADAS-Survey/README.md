# Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) Survey Analysis

### What is this?

This repo contains work for a take-home assignment for a nonprofit publisher which performs research and investigative reporting in the service of consumers. I was not asked to continue in the interview process after completing this assignment.

### What was this take-home about?

For this assignment, I was provided compiled survey data from **ADAS_Verbatim_Demo data for candidates.xlsx**, which details car owner satisfaction levels and free text feedback regarding their experiences with different ADAS types:

* Lane Departure Warning
* Front Collision Avoidance
* Rear Collision Avoidance
* Blind Spot Monitor
* Cruise Control

across a wide range of 2018 makes and models. Using this data, I was asked to create a written report or slide deck to report which systems drive better sentiment compared to others, focusing on:

* Features of systems driving positive/negative results
* Differences in experiences by model year, car make, or model that stood out

Presently, I have included the slide deck I created to describe my findings:

* Keynote: **ADASSurveyAnalysis.key**
* PDF: **ADASSurveyAnalysis.pdf**

I will be adding a Jupyter Notebook soon to detail the bulk of the work I did for this assignment, not just to illustrate my workflow here but also to have at least one place on my Github where I have example code snippets of common EDA and plotting operations in Python, pandas, matplotlib, etc. Also, may include some additional code just to work on developing interactive visualizations.

### Notes

* I don't think I structured my slide deck particularly well in retrospect. Probably needed more slides to summarize findings up front and some of the more detailed slides describing findings for each particular system were a bit too busy and the key takeaways needed to be more salient.
* I felt I had good reason to reduce the satisfaction into basic Positive/Negative levels, but it may have simplified things too much? Also since I went down that road, it might have been stronger attempting something more rigorous (a supervised learning approach?) to capture which features drove specific sentiments.
