# Shapes Data Test

### What is this?

This repo contains work for a take-home assignment for a software company which provides solutions for preventing fraud in online and mobile transactions. From completion of this assignment, I was informed that I passed and then moved on to a second phone screen, which was the extent of my progress.

### What was this take-home about?

For this assignment, I was asked to use the provided dataset **Analyst Coding Test.csv** to answer a series of questions which were mostly Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tasks. These questions and my answers are included in the notebook **Shapes Data Test.ipynb**.
